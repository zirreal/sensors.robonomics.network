After a year with Altruist you will see, in clear graphs with insights from the developers, how air quality varies by time of day, season, the operation of waste-incineration plants, industrial sites, power stations, seasonal fires, dust storms… and you’ll form an objective view of what is happening right outside your window—and adapt to it.')}}</p>
