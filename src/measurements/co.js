  description: "The particles of CO (carbon monoxide) outdoors represent gaseous pollution formed during incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, especially in the exhaust gases of vehicles. Elevated levels of CO can have a negative impact on health, leading to poisoning. Restricting emissions and using protective masks can help reduce CO levels and improve air quality.Outdoors, the level of CO pollution (carbon monoxide) is typically measured in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m³) of air.",
